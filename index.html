      <h1 class="header">Do you want a Monster Code<span>?</span></h1>
      <p>
        I'm The Monster and I make codes. I used to be known as <span class="emph blurple">Ellexide Codes</span> and I will continue to hold ownership over that name and all codes linked thereof. This is a mere rebranding.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="noteEmph fRed">Backstory:</span> I do love the bubbly nature of Ellexide and me as a person will continue to do so. The only reason for the dark "Monster" aesthetic is because my friend always teased me for my "monstrous codes" and how much memory they seemed to take. I liked the ring to it and it made sense since my Discord has been: <span class="noteEmph blurple">Lil Monster#3557</span> for over 2 years now.
      </p>
      <p>
         I do coding and layouts for all kinds of people as well as all kinds of uses--not just character profiles. I also offer different types of services like simple image rendering, website/profile manipulations, and coding tutorials. But if it is art you are looking for, <i class="greyple">(art commissions, image fixes, logo making)</i>, I will refer you to my partner in crime: <span class="emph fGreen">Wenzie</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a lot of sections in this mini-website. So, please feel free to poke around. If you need any help, DM me on Discord, send me a mail on this RPC account, or send me an email: <b class="blurple">ellexidecodes@gmail.com</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have few rules when it comes to my layouts, all revolving around respecting me as the coder and respecting my work. The rules are as follows:
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li><b class="red">Do not redistribute my code.</b> I worked really hard on it. All I ask is for respect for my work.</li>
          <li><b class="red">Do not remove any of my credits--both in the hidden CSS as well as visible credit.</b> This includes the copyright and all the associated links.</li>
          <li><b class="red">Do not search for, decipher, try to obtain, or copy any part of the code.</b> They are hidden for a reason. With my copyright, I am eligible to sue you for theft of intellectual property. I don't wish to let it ever get that far.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        As I said, I only ask for a few things. In return for all your patience, support, and respect for my work, I will do my best to give you a pleasant working experience with me as well as ever growing skills and experience. This way, I can continue to give you the best outputs I can offer.
      </p>

      <h2>04/06/2019</h2>
      <p>
        What do you think of the rebranding? I personally think it fits. I haven't had a rebranding in a while and the dark brooding aesthetic was always something I was drawn to. I'm glad I made the change. This does not mean that my codes will all be monstrous though. I will continue to code as I do, that means minimalistic profiles are also still in play.

          <li>The bulk of all codes are all backed up and hosted elsewhere. This does <b class="blurple">not</b> mean that you will not be able to edit it. You can still edit it through the given variables.</li>
          <li>I reserve the right to demand that you take down my layout if I see fit. The reasons for having the code taken down will one or more of the following:</li>
          <ul class="inner">
            <li>Claiming my code as your own.</li>
            <li>Removed credit from my code and refused to put it back--either explicitly or refusal to reply to any contact.</li>
            <li>Copied a large chunk of any of my code that is not under the MIT license.</li>
            <li>You have been blacklisted from using my codes before.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>I offer <b class="blurple">more</b> than just roleplay.chat profile code layouts. I also offer:</li>
          <ul class="inner">
            <li>Room Website Coding</li>
            <li>Personal Portfolio Coding</li>

            <li>Coding Lessons <i class="fGreen">[New]</i></li>
          </ul>
          <li>My codes will take time usually because I have work and school but I will always inform you if I end up taking longer than necessary.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Commissions <i class="green">(Open)</i></h2>
      <p>
        My commissions are often open though the available slots often change depending on how busy I can get. Though, if you are willing to wait until I am able to accomodate you then feel free to head over to <span class="unset-style emph fRed" opens="list">my on going list</span> to see who is on my waiting list, who I am accomodating, and what stage I am with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once I am accomodating you, I will have complete transparency and try to maintain constant communication as I work through your profile. Some basic things to remember:
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>I do not take less than <b class="fGreen">15USD</b> for profile codes that use CSS/HTML</li>
          <li>On the other hand, I do not take less than <b class="fGreen">20USD</b> for profile codes that use JS/CSS/HTML</li>
          <li>I will ask you for your budget so the higher the budget range, the more complex the code. But this also means that I might be asking for a higher base price so please <i class="fRed">be honest when you give me a budget range.</i> Giving me a higher budget than what you can actually afford thus making me work harder and using up time and skill, all the while planning to pay me on the low end is also unfair. It <b>is</b> still considered labor.</li>
          <li>If you are here to commission Room Website coding, Personal Portfolios, or hire me for front end development of non-roleplay websites, <b class="blurple">the prices above do not apply</b>. It will fully depend on the complexity of design and general size of the project.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The process will be as follows:
        <ol>
          <li><b class="fGreen">Consultation</b> - I will be asking you a series of questions that pertain to the character you want me to make a profile of. They are very simplye questions like "What is the aura you want portrayed in the profile?" or "Do you have a theme in mind?" This will happen immediately when you are added to my commission list. If you are on the waiting list, I will not be doing a consultation with you.
          <li><b class="fGreen">Visualization</b> - After the the Consultation and when I am ready to start working on your layout, I will be going over the first imagery I can think of for your profile. This stage does not stop until I am able to deliver to you the final output.</li>
          <li><b class="fGreen">Transaction</b> - Assuming we have passed the Visualization stage and you are already content with the layout I have given you a full preview of, I will start to compress the code for your consumption while sending you a link for the payment. I will not be asking for you to pay upfront or pay half. The only time I will take your money is when you are ready to receive your code. Once I have received the official receipt and e-mail from PayPal, your code will be sent to you along with a quick documentation if it is needed.</li>
          <li><b class="fGreen">Grace Period</b> - 7 days after you have received your profile, you are eligible to ask major changes from me. They will all be for free as you are entitled to it. After that, I will always be available for small changes as well as code support. But if you want something that could essentially be a layout change, I <i class="fYellow">might</i> ask for a small fee. Eitherway, you are welcome to ask me for changes even after 7 days just to see if it is something I can do for free or not.</li>
        </ol>

      <p>The coders and artists linked below have either take requests, do commissions, or have some free work you can grab (on the coders end). Please explore their profile/landing hub and what they have to offer! I quite admire them.</p>
      <p>
        People under personal favourites and friends are people I am associated with, personally know, <b class="blurple">or</b> people who have highly inspired me in my journey through coding. It's not that I think they are better than everyone else. They just have influenced me personally and would like to give them a special place in my profile.

        <li><a href="https://roleplay.chat/profile.php?user=words" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="blurple unset-style">Words</a> - Though their profile is very minimal, they are also very generous with their code.

        <li><a href="https://roleplay.chat/profile.php?user=Alcyone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="blurple unset-style">Alcyone</a> - She's been coding on RPC far longer than I have.
