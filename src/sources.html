      The coders and artists linked below have either take requests, do commissions, or have some free work you can grab (on the coders end). Please explore their profile/landing hub and what they have to offer! I quite admire them.

      People under personal favourites and friends are people I am associated with, personally know, <b class="blurple">or</b> people who have highly inspired me in my journey through coding. It's not that I think they are better than everyone else. They just have influenced me personally and would like to give them a special place in my profile.

They are well made and all very aesthetically pleasing.</li>

      <li><a href="https://roleplay.chat/profile.php?user=Yandere+Codes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="blurple unset-style">Yandere Codes</a> - Yandere has a very versatile type coding design. She can do minimal and complex codes as far as I can see. Her prices are also very fair. Yandere does not only offer profile coding though--there are other things she does from rendering images to making room topics. Check out her <a href="https://thefallencorp.wixsite.com/yandere-codes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="greyple unset-style">website</a> for a more detailed view</li>
      <li><a href="http://tessisamess.insanejournal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="blurple unset-style">Tess</a> - I have no idea who Tess is but I have seen this link be passed around often. And upon exploring, I can say she has some amazing code snippets and layouts. Give it a shot! <i class="red"><b>Warning:</b> I do not actually know if they work on RPC and I haven't tried.</i></li>
      <li><a href="https://glenthemes.tumblr.com/portfolio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="blurple unset-style">Glen Themes</a> - Much like Tess, I don't know who runs this blog but they have a very great eye for design and aesthetic. I'm 100% down for it. See their portfolio. Maybe you'll find something you'll like.</li>
