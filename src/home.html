    <h1 class="header">Do you want a Monster Code?</h1>
    <p>
      I'm The Monster and I make codes. I used to be known as <span class="emph blurple">Ellexide Codes</span> and I will continue to hold ownership over that name and all codes linked thereof. This is a mere rebranding.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="noteEmph fRed">Backstory:</span> I do love the bubbly nature of Ellexide and me as a person will continue to do so. The only reason for the dark "Monster" aesthetic is because my friend always teased me for my "monstrous codes" and how "large and in charge" they always seemed. I liked the ring to it and it made sense since my Discord has been: <span class="noteEmph blurple">Innate Monster#3557</span> for over 2 years now.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do coding and layouts for all kinds of people as well as all kinds of uses--not just character profiles. I also offer different types of services like:
    </p>
      <ul class="bullet">
        <li>Room Website Coding</li>
        <li>Personal Portfolio Coding</li>
        <li>Profile Edits <i class="fYellow">(either codes made by me or someone else)</i></li>
        <li>Image Editing</li>
        <li>Coding Lessons</li>
        <li>Room Topics <i class="fGreen">[New]</i></li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      But if it is art you are looking for, <i class="greyple">(art commissions, image fixes, logo making)</i>, I will refer you to my partner in crime: <span class="emph fGreen">Wenzie</span> If you want to contact her, you can contact her through me and I'll connect the two of you. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a lot of sections in this mini-website. So, please feel free to poke around. If you need any help, DM me on Discord, send me a mail on this RPC account, or send me an email: <a href="mailto:ellexidecodes@gmail.com" class="blurple">ellexidecodes@gmail.com</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      I have few rules when it comes to my layouts, all revolving around respecting me as the coder and respecting my work. The rules are as follows:
      <ul class="bullet">
        <li><b class="red">Do not redistribute my code.</b> I worked really hard on it. All I ask is for respect for my work.</li>
        <li><b class="red">Do not remove any of my credits--both in the hidden CSS as well as visible credit.</b> This includes the copyright and all the associated links.</li>
        <li><b class="red">Do not search for, decipher, try to obtain, or copy any part of the code.</b> They are hidden for a reason. With my copyright, I am eligible to sue you for theft of intellectual property. I don't wish to let it ever get that far.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      As I said, I only ask for a few things. In return for all your patience, support, and respect for my work, I will do my best to give you a pleasant working experience with me as well as ever growing skills and experience. This way, I can continue to give you the best outputs I can offer.
