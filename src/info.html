      <ul class="bullet">
        <li>The bulk of all codes are all backed up and hosted elsewhere. This does <b class="blurple">not</b> mean that you will not be able to edit it. You can still edit it through the given variables.</li>
        <li>I reserve the right to demand that you take down my layout if I see fit. The reasons for having the code taken down will one or more of the following:</li>
        <ul class="inner">
          <li>Claiming my code as your own.</li>
          <li>Removed credit from my code and refused to put it back--either explicitly or refusal to reply to any contact.</li>
          <li>Copied a large chunk of any of my code that is not under the MIT license.</li>
          <li>You have been blacklisted from using my codes before.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>I offer <b class="blurple">more</b> than just roleplay.chat profile code layouts. I also offer:</li>
        <ul class="inner">
          <li>Room Website Coding</li>
          <li>Personal Portfolio Coding</li>
          <li>Profile Edits <i class="fYellow">(either codes made by me or someone else)</i></li>
          <li>Image Editing</li>
          <li>Coding Lessons <i class="fGreen">[New]</i></li>
        </ul>
        <li>My codes will take time usually because I have work and school but I will always inform you if I end up taking longer than necessary.</li>

    <h2>Commissions <i class="green">(Open)</i></h2>
    <p>
      My commissions are often open though the available slots often change depending on how busy I can get. Though, if you are willing to wait until I am able to accomodate you then feel free to head over to <span class="unset-style emph fRed" opens="list">my on going list</span> to see who is on my waiting list, who I am accomodating, and what stage I am with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once I am accomodating you, I will have complete transparency and try to maintain constant communication as I work through your profile. Some basic things to remember:
      <ul class="bullet">
        <li>I do not take less than <b class="fGreen">15USD</b> for profile codes that use CSS/HTML</li>
        <li>On the other hand, I do not take less than <b class="fGreen">20USD</b> for profile codes that use JS/CSS/HTML</li>
        <li>I will ask you for your budget so the higher the budget range, the more complex the code. But this also means that I might be asking for a higher base price so please <i class="fRed">be honest when you give me a budget range.</i> Giving me a higher budget than what you can actually afford thus making me work harder and using up time and skill, all the while planning to pay me on the low end is also unfair. It <b>is</b> still considered labor.</li>
        <li>If you are here to commission Room Website coding, Personal Portfolios, or hire me for front end development of non-roleplay websites, <b class="blurple">the prices above do not apply</b>. It will fully depend on the complexity of design and general size of the project.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The process will be as follows:
      <ol>
        <li><b class="fGreen">Consultation</b> - I will be asking you a series of questions that pertain to the character you want me to make a profile of. They are very simplye questions like "What is the aura you want portrayed in the profile?" or "Do you have a theme in mind?" This will happen immediately when you are added to my commission list. If you are on the waiting list, I will not be doing a consultation with you.
        <li><b class="fGreen">Visualization</b> - After the the Consultation and when I am ready to start working on your layout, I will be going over the first imagery I can think of for your profile. This stage does not stop until I am able to deliver to you the final output.</li>
        <li><b class="fGreen">Transaction</b> - Assuming we have passed the Visualization stage and you are already content with the layout I have given you a full preview of, I will start to compress the code for your consumption while sending you a link for the payment. I will not be asking for you to pay upfront or pay half. The only time I will take your money is when you are ready to receive your code. Once I have received the official receipt and e-mail from PayPal, your code will be sent to you along with a quick documentation if it is needed.</li>
        <li><b class="fGreen">Grace Period</b> - 7 days after you have received your profile, you are eligible to ask major changes from me. They will all be for free as you are entitled to it. After that, I will always be available for small changes as well as code support. But if you want something that could essentially be a layout change, I <i class="fYellow">might</i> ask for a small fee. Eitherway, you are welcome to ask me for changes even after 7 days just to see if it is something I can do for free or not.</li>
      </ol>
