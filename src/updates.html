      Okay so bear with me, I just had a new idea. Since my new faceclaim is <i class="fRed">Leliel</i> from <i class="blurple">The Angelarium</i>, I thought I'd pay homage to the other Angels I fancy in that collections, from the Emanations to the Zodiacs. Not all of them but probably most.

      If you wish to claim an angel and want to pre-order their code to not be turned into a free code but be yours instead, DM me on Discord and we'll discuss it!

      What do you think of the rebranding? I personally think it fits. I haven't had a rebranding in a while and the dark brooding aesthetic was always something I was drawn to. I'm glad I made the change. This does not mean that my codes will all be monstrous though. I will continue to code as I do, that means minimalistic profiles are also still in play.
