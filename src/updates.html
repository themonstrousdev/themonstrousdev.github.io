      With COVID-19 being a thing, I have been roped into making a software for this pandemic in our country. With that being a full time gig until further notice on top of classes, I have no time to able to take commissions. I deeply apologize. I will be back as soon as I can but I am unable to give a date. Please check out <span class="unset-style blurple" opens="list" head="List | The Monster Layouts">my recommended/favourites coders</span> if you want to get a new code!

      It has been a hot minute. I'm back in the scene! Technically, I <i>haven't</i> left. I was just extremely busy with school so it was a forced hiatus. I still continued to receive commissions from people who were willing to wait. I'm updating my list now so you can see it in <span class="unset-style blurple" opens="list" head="List | The Monster Layouts">here!</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you guys for being so patient with me!

      Hi guys! I should've updated when I had the chance. This update is long overdue but I am going an a bit of hiatus from coding. I've been extremely busy with a lot of irl things and honestly, I don't quite know how long I can keep up coding for RPC. I will continue to code for my friends and I will do my extreme best to finish all those people who have commissioned from me before I went on hiatus.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know there are a couple of have been waiting months and are patiently waiting for it, and honestly, God bless you. I will deliver but it will take a while. There is a lot on my plate right now and soon there are things I will be needing to shed. I don't quite know if coding for RPC is one of them yet. I don't want it to be and it probably will not be. But it will definitely mean I will be coding much less.
    </p>
    <p>
      God speed to all you who have stayed this far and have believed in me, supported me, and have hired me. I have a list of a lot of coders I have enjoyed both working with, talking, and even used some of their codes for my profiles. I will always be available in Discord and RPC Mail. Check out all these <span class="unset-style blurple" opens="sources" head="Other Sources | The Monster Layouts">awesome coderbois!</span>

      I am back! <i class="greyple">I'm very exhausted</i> but I am back nonetheless. I know I promised a raffle and as tired as I am, I like to make good with my promises so here we go! There is no condition for you to join the raffle. Just fill out the form below and I will announce the winner by mid-July!

      Hi guys! My waiting list is <b class="red">currently closed</b>. I'm going to finish my current list and my on-hold list as soon as I can, while not accepting any new ones. My finals are coming up and I'm really trying to focus on that. <u>I'm not closing it down completely, of course.</u> If you are willing to wait, I can add you to the list but I'm stating it as closed because I don't know when I can be back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fret not! I'll be back with a fury! On the day that I start commissions again, I'll be starting a raffle for a <b class="yellow emph">Gold Tier</b> profile. That means you can have entrance animations, JS-integrated features, friend modals, mobile compatibility, in-profile crush tag/comment tag, etc! I've come a long way since I started coding almost 3 years ago now. You guys have supported me, given me constructive criticism, and helped me improve.
    </p>
    <p>
      I just want to give back to you guys for all that you've given me. I know I may not be around RPC much nowadays, but my DMs always open as well as my Discord. Included in the raffle will also be coding classes if you so choose instead of a profile. Of course, I would like to put a limit on how elaborate it can be. I don't want to keep working on it forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="blurple emph">NOTE:</span> If I get enough funds to pay my partner-in-crime who is also an artist <a href="http://roleplay.chat/profile.php?user=Wenzie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="blurple">Wenzie</a> to make custom art for you if you win the raffle, I can make that an option as well.

      I would like to put somebody on blast for their blatant disrespect for copyright, licenses, intellectual property, and proper research/legal advice. They showed a screenshot (which they wonderfully named "HAHA.png", quite mature.) that stated "website code cannot be copyrighted" from a blog post that explicitly states <i class="blurple">"Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer and this should not be considered legal advice. Consider this as research with actionable items based on my experience, research and expertise as a seasoned web developer."</i> But let's get down to the nitty gritty, shall we?
    </p>
    <p>
      The user, hiding behind the name "Outlander", disrespected International Copyright Law by basically showcasing threat and challenging my copyright claim to my source code. Let me be perfectly clear, <b class="red">my code is my own. It is under copyright. You may not copy it.</b> It is under the <b class="red">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License</b> Now what does that mean? Let me lay it out for you:
      <ul class="bullet">
        <li>The source code is my intellectual property, made by me, and published by me.</li>
        <li>I choose who can and cannot use my code in any platform.</li>
        <li>I can <u>and I will</u> contact DMCA if you break any of my terms.</li>
        <li><b class="red">The source code</b> is my intellectual property. If you are going to recreate my layouts <u class="emph">using custom code</u>, you are <b class="green">not committing copyright infringement.</b> It's just like tracing art. People look down on it but it is not illegal. By doing so, you are either learning--which I am more than willing to help you learn and make designs and layouts <b>of your very own</b>, or you're just being slightly shitty about recreating my design concept.</li>
        <li>If "your" code is way too similar to my code and you have no proof of you actually making this custom code, <b class="red">you are most likely committing copyright infringement and I will start an investigation.</b></li>
        <li>A custom website gives you ownership of your unique design, and another site/user cannot legally copy it.</li>
        <li>You cannot copyright a technique, concept, idea, etc. It is the tangible item that is copyrighted--saved on paper, on a hard-drive, etc. Which is why recreating a look is not illegal, but taking the code is.</li>
        <li>You can share (NOT USE) my work but under the following terms:
          <ul class="inner">
            <li>You must give me <b class="red">full credit</b>, and indicate if changes are made to the copyrighted material. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.</li>
            <li>You cannot use it for commercial use so you cannot resell my code.</li>
            <li>If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you may not distribute the modified material.</li>
            <li>You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits <b class="blurple">or</b> legally allow others from doing anything the license does <b class="red">not</b> permit.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      I take pride in my work and I will not disrespect the people who have <b class="green">paid</b> me for the code. By taking any of the source code for your own use--even if you are thinking "Oh, you'll have to find me to sue me."--you are <span class="red">bound</span> by the terms I have set. I will contact, DMCA and show them this blatant thievery, you will be obligated to take it down. If you have any issues with this, you can come into my DMs proving even more how shitty people can be for, again, <b class="red">disrespecting copyright, licenses, intellectual property, the person paying for the code, the muses of the code, the coder herself, and International Copyright Law.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Outlander, darling, feel free to use my free codes for your profile, while leaving in the proper credit and not copying the code for any such personal use without my explicit permission. I'm not greedy. If you ask me explicitly that there is a part of the code, or a whole code you really want to use and edit for your own to build up on, I will genuinely consider giving it to you. I was a teacher and my heart will continue to want to teach. But I get disrespectful when I'm disrespected. I <b>will</b> take legal action. God bless.

      Okay so bear with me, I just had a new idea. Since my new faceclaim is <i class="fRed">Leliel</i> from <i class="blurple">The Angelarium</i>, I thought I'd pay homage to the other Angels I fancy in that collection, from the Emanations to the Zodiacs. Not all of them but probably most.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll be starting a series of free codes that will be part of the "Angelarium" series named after the angels they were fashioned after. If you wish to claim an angel and want to pre-order their code to not be turned into a free code but be yours instead, DM me on Discord and we'll discuss it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Preruse the angels: <a href="https://www.angelarium.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="fGreen">The Angelarium</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b class="red">ON ANOTHER NOTE:</b> I now have a <span class="unset-style" opens="feedback">feedback form</span> for if you want to give me comments or leave love about my codes and what you think about working with me! It will be automatically added to my profile so you can see it pop up!

      What do you think of the rebranding? I personally think it fits. I haven't had a rebranding in a while and the dark brooding aesthetic was always something I was drawn to. I'm glad I made the change. This does not mean that my codes will all be monstrous though. I will continue to code as I do, that means minimalistic profiles are also still in play.
