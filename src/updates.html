      Okay so bear with me, I just had a new idea. Since my new faceclaim is <i class="fRed">Leliel</i> from <i class="blurple">The Angelarium</i>, I thought I'd pay homage to the other Angels I fancy in that collection, from the Emanations to the Zodiacs. Not all of them but probably most.

      I'll be starting a series of free codes that will be part of the "Angelarium" series named after the angels they were fashioned after. If you wish to claim an angel and want to pre-order their code to not be turned into a free code but be yours instead, DM me on Discord and we'll discuss it!

      <b class="red">ON ANOTHER NOTE:</b> I now have a <span class="unset-style" opens="feedback">feedback form</span> for if you want to give me comments or leave love about my codes and what you think about working with me! It will be automatically added to my profile so you can see it pop up!

      What do you think of the rebranding? I personally think it fits. I haven't had a rebranding in a while and the dark brooding aesthetic was always something I was drawn to. I'm glad I made the change. This does not mean that my codes will all be monstrous though. I will continue to code as I do, that means minimalistic profiles are also still in play.
