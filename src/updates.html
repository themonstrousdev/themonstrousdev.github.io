      What do you think of the rebranding? I personally think it fits. I haven't had a rebranding in a while and the dark brooding aesthetic was always something I was drawn to. I'm glad I made the change. This does not mean that my codes will all be monstrous though. I will continue to code as I do, that means minimalistic profiles are also still in play.
